# Welcome to ClassPilot

ClassPilot is a lightweight class management app built for individual teachers—not entire schools. It gives teachers the tools to organize their students, manage classes, and keep track of who’s enrolled in what. This isn’t a school-wide admin system. It’s a personal assistant for teachers who want to stay organized, whether they’re teaching one class or ten. Teachers can create an account, add their students, build classes, assign students to those classes, and start managing them with ease. This is the kind of tool a tutor, after-school program leader, or classroom teacher might actually use. It’s simple, private, and focused on just the core functionality teachers need.
